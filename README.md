# CustomNotificationSounds
 Neos mod that provides an easy way to change Neos notification sounds
 
 ## How it works
 Simply copy the NeosDB links of the StaticAudioClips for the sounds you want to change, and add them to the config. NeosModSettings mod is highly recommended to make the process easier.

 Yearn for the nostalgiac Neos sounds? Try these!

## Note
While my mod adds support for changing the credit send and recieve sounds, this does not mean I endorse Karel or NCR. I simply did so for the sake of giving easy access to changing every notification sound.
